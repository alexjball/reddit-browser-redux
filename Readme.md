# reddit-browser-redux
Universal Reddit browser demonstrating test setup for Expo managed workflows.

# CI/CD

Tests run on all branches. On master, when tests pass, we deploy the web app to [Firebase](https://universal-reddit-browser.web.app/) and publish the mobile app to [Expo](https://expo.io/@alexjball/universal-reddit-browser).

Deployment is configured using environment variables configured in [Travis settings](https://travis-ci.com/github/alexjball/reddit-browser-redux/settings):

- `FIREBASE_PROJECT`: The name of the firebase project to deploy to. It should have hosting enabled.
- `FIREBASE_TOKEN`: The access token used to authenticate with Firebase, generated by `firebase login:ci`.
- `EXPO_CLI_USERNAME`: The account with which to publish the mobile app.
- `EXPO_CLI_PASSWORD`: The password used to authenticate with Expo.
